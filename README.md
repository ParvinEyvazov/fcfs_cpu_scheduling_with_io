# fcfs_cpu_scheduling_with_io
FCFS (First Come First Served) is a cpu scheduling algorithm in Operating Systems. This is an modified verion of FCFS that Processes has IO times.

## Explantion of code

There is a text file that includes our processes and these processes has their own tuples.This tuples includes CPU burst and I/O burst times. The program have to schedule them that makes that CPU is going to work in every possible time or in other words, this program is a FCFS scheduling algorithm with IO.
